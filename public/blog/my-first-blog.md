This is my first post on my new blog. I'm using Markdown to write it, which makes formatting super easy.

I can make text **bold**, *italic*, or even `code snippets`.

This new system is very manageable. To add a new post, I just create a new `.md` file and add one line to a "table of contents" JSON file.
