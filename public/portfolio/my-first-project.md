This website is the first project I want to share with you!  
It is a **single-page application** mainly written in: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, supported by Bootstrap and jQuery. Now it's hosted on GitHub Pages.

**Why is it so "ancient"?**  
The earliest version of this website is an assginment of the undergrade course (COMP 307: Principles of Web Development) that I took back at McGill. This course forbids "modern" web frameworks (e.g. React, Vue, Angular, etc.) and only allows HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.
Now, I've turned it into my official side project and will be making regular updates whenever I have free time.

**Friendly Reminder:** The source code of this project should be used solely for your personal and educational purposes. You should **not** use it as a copy-paste shortcut for your course assignment, or for commercial purposes.  
Otherwise, feel free to play around, check out or/and **star** my repository :)  

Thank you for your interest and please make yourself at home.
